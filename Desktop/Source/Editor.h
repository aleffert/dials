// How to add an editor:
// 1. Declare an instance of DLSEditor. This will be shared by both your iOS app and your
// desktop plugin.
// 2. In your desktop plugin, implement <code>EditorControllerGenerating</code> and, if appropriate,  <code>CodeGenerating</code>.
// 3. In your iOS app, add a property that should be modified with that editor.

@protocol DLSEditor;

/// Supplies information needed to configure your <code>EditorController</code> for a field.

/// The editor that should be used to edit this field.

/// The current value of the field.
